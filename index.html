   <p>At fifteen years of age, I was in a musical slump. There was no one out musically that held my interest. One day my friend introduced me to Japanese pop artists, and nothing has been the same since<p>

   <p>Ayumi Hamasaki was the first Japanese artist that I fell in love with. Her album My Story changed my life. About You, My Name's WOMAN, and Liar were a few of the songs that I enjoyed </p>

      <p>I became aware of Utada Hikaru thanks to the videogame Kingdom Hearts. It was after that that I became aware of her other songs like Tokyo Nights, Wait and See, and Can You Keep a Secret. I also learned that not only was she well known in Japan, but she was originally from New York City</p>

   <p>More music would only come as the months went on, especially because I discovered YouTube, and with it the talented Crystal Kay. She is of African-American and Korean descent, but was born and raised in Yokohama. Her first single came out when she was thirteen and was titled Eternal Dreams. Since then she has made a huge impact on J-pop and J-r&b. She is also a huge inspiration for other mixed raced artists who perform in Japan </p>

   <p>Speaking of Crystal Kay, she has worked with many artists; including K-pop queen BoA, the rap duo M-FLO, and Namie Amuro </p>

   <p>This is merely a small list of the artists who I enjoy on a daily basis. </p>
